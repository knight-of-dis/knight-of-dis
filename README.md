Hi, I'm Knight.

I've been in and out of the tech industry for almost two decades. Coming back into it now, relearning all the tools and learning all the changes that have come about.
Lucily HTML hasn't changed all that much. I'm learning Python and relearning SQL after nearly a decade of not touching it.

I'm interested in an resources anyone can provide on my learning journey so if you come across this and have something you think might be helpful fell free to reach out.

Outside of Python and SQL, I'm also self teaching myself xCode and Swift.

My to-do list is long and I'll be starting on a few projects in the next few months and will welcome any guidance you can give.
